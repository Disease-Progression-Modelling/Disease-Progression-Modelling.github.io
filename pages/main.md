# Disease Progression Modelling

The Disease Progression Modelling community gathers researchers, engineers, doctors and many more

This website is a first step to gather different contributors within a single website that propose didactic tutorials to grasp

It should include:
- Get started
- introduction
- Different approaches : overview of some approaches
- Bibliography of the state of the art of DPM

Will be done by Neil Oxtoby
